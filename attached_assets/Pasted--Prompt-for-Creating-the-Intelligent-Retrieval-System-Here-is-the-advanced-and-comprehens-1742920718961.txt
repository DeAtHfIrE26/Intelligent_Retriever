**Prompt:**

"I want you to create an advanced and futuristic document retrieval system that surpasses all existing systems in terms of performance, scalability, design, and intelligence. The system should be built using state-of-the-art technologies and must incorporate innovative features that make it 100x more efficient, responsive, and impressive than anything currently available. This system should be modular, scalable, and capable of handling real-time document retrieval with exceptional accuracy and speed. Below are the requirements for the system:  

### **Core Features**
1. **Advanced Retrieval Engine**:
   - Use cutting-edge AI models like GPT-4 or beyond for semantic search and contextual understanding.
   - Integrate vector embeddings (e.g., OpenAI Embeddings or Sentence Transformers) for document indexing.
   - Implement hybrid search combining keyword-based search with semantic search.

2. **Database and Storage**:
   - Utilize Neo4j or other graph databases for relational data storage.
   - Incorporate a distributed database system like MongoDB or PostgreSQL for non-relational data.
   - Ensure real-time synchronization across databases.

3. **Caching Mechanism**:
   - Implement high-performance caching (e.g., Redis or Memcached) to minimize latency during API requests.

4. **Background Data Scraping**:
   - Build a service that continuously scrapes relevant documents from websites, APIs, or RSS feeds and automatically updates the database.
   - Include intelligent filters to avoid redundant or irrelevant data.

5. **API Design**:
   - Provide RESTful and GraphQL APIs for seamless integration with frontend applications.
   - Include endpoints for advanced search queries, user authentication, health checks, and analytics.

6. **User Management**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for secure user management.
   - Monitor user activity and enforce rate-limiting to prevent abuse.

7. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Log API performance metrics such as inference time, request frequency, and error rates.
   - Use tools like Prometheus/Grafana for real-time observability.

8. **Deployment**:
   - Dockerize the application for consistent deployment across environments.
   - Provide Kubernetes support for scaling the application dynamically.

### **UI/UX Design**
1. Create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using modern frameworks like React.js or Vue.js.
2. Ensure responsiveness across devices (mobile-first design).
3. Include features like real-time search suggestions, document previews, and interactive filters.
4. Use animations and transitions to enhance user experience without compromising performance.

### **Advanced Features**
1. **AI-Powered Recommendations**:
   - Suggest related documents based on user behavior and search history using collaborative filtering algorithms.
   
2. **Natural Language Querying**:
   - Allow users to input queries in natural language (e.g., "Find all documents about AI advancements").
   
3. **Multi-Language Support**:
   - Enable multilingual document retrieval using translation APIs.

4. **Customizable Dashboards**:
   - Provide users with personalized dashboards to track their activity, saved searches, and preferences.

5. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES).
   - Use anomaly detection algorithms to identify suspicious activities.

6. **Scalability & Fault Tolerance**:
   - Implement load balancing mechanisms (e.g., NGINX or AWS Elastic Load Balancer).
   - Ensure fault tolerance with automated failover strategies.

### **Technologies to Use**
1. Backend: Python (FastAPI/Django/Flask), Node.js
2. Frontend: React.js/Vue.js/Next.js
3. Database: Neo4j + MongoDB/PostgreSQL
4. Caching: Redis/Memcached
5. Deployment: Docker/Kubernetes
6. Observability: Prometheus/Grafana

### **Installation Instructions**
Ensure that the system is easy to set up by providing clear installation instructions:
1. Set up a virtual environment for Python dependencies.
2. Configure database credentials securely.
3. Run Docker containers with minimal manual intervention.

### **Output Expectations**
The final system should be capable of:
1. Retrieving documents instantly with high accuracy.
2. Handling millions of concurrent users without performance degradation.
3. Providing an unmatched user experience through advanced UI/UX design.
4. Supporting continuous updates via background scraping services.
5. Offering detailed analytics on API usage and performance metrics.

### **Additional Notes**
- Avoid hardcoding configurations; use environment variables instead.
- Ensure modularity so that future upgrades can be added seamlessly."
